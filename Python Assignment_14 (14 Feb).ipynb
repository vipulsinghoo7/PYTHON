    "# Q1. What is Multi Threading in Python? Why it is used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multithreading in Python is a technique where a program is divided into multiple threads of execution that can run concurrently. Each thread is a separate flow of control that can perform a specific task, and the threads share the same memory space, allowing them to communicate and coordinate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Multithreading is used in Python to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and make programs more efficient by utilizing the available hardware resources. It is especially useful in applications that involve I/O operations or other tasks that are blocking, as it allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the blocked task to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "-In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. This module provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and managing threads, with support for features such as thread synchronization, thread-safe data structures, and thread communication. The threading module is part of the standard Python library, so it is available on all platforms where Python is supported."

    "\" Resource sharing \": Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory and CPU time, which can lead to more efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\" Asynchronous execution \": Multithreading can be used to perform asynchronous I/O operations, where the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete. This can improve the responsiveness of the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "---Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "\" Complexity \": Multithreading adds complexity to a program, making it more difficult to design, develop, and debug. It can be challenging to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\" Overhead \": Multithreading introduces overhead in terms of memory and CPU time, as each thread requires its own stack and context switching between threads requires additional processing time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deadlock and race condition are two common types of concurrency-related bugs that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\" Deadlock \": A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources they need to continue execution. This results in a situation where no thread can make progress and the program appears to hang. Deadlocks can occur when threads compete for exclusive access to resources, such as shared memory or a network socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\" Race condition \": A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the order or timing of thread execution. Specifically, it occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource in an unpredictable order, resulting in unexpected behavior. For example, if two threads both try to write to the same variable at the same time, the final value of the variable will depend on the order in which the writes occur."
